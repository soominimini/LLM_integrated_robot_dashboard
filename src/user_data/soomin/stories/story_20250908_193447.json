  "story": "Soomin's Sunny Adventure\n\nSoomin loved playing outside on sunny days! Soomin packed a basket with yummy apples and set out to find the most beautiful flower garden in the whole town.\n\nAs Soomin walked, the bright sun shone down, making the yellow flowers look extra happy. Soomin saw big, red apples on the trees and thought, \"Wow! Those are juicy apples!\" (Learning descriptive words: juicy)\n\nSoomin's basket had three shiny eggs from Grandma's chickens. Soomin wanted to take them to show her friend. Soomin said, \"I have three eggs!\" (Practicing plural forms)\n\nBut then, oh no! A big puddle blocked the path to the flower garden. Soomin didn't know how to get across. Just then, a friendly squirrel named Squeaky came by and said, \"Don't worry, little one! I can help you.\"\n\nSqueaky showed Soomin that they could jump from rock to rock over the puddle. Soomin jumped and landed safely on each rock, feeling brave and strong (Understanding spatial concepts: jumping from one place to another).\n\nWhen Soomin finally reached the flower garden, it was even more beautiful than imagined! The flowers were big and yellow, with petals as soft as feathers. Soomin said, \"Wow! This is the most beautiful garden ever!\"\n\nSqueaky smiled and said, \"You did it, Soomin! You're so brave!\" Soomin beamed with pride and felt happy to have achieved her goal.\n\nAs Soomin walked back home, Squeaky jumped ahead to show the way. Soomin's basket was full of apples, and she couldn't wait to share them with her friend. The end.",
