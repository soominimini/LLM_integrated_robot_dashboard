  "story": "Soomin's Sunshine Garden\n\nSoomin loved playing outside. One sunny day, Soomin decided to plant a beautiful garden in her backyard. She wanted it to be the brightest and most colorful garden on the whole block.\n\nFirst, Soomin went to the store with her mom to buy some seeds and flowers. \"I want yellow sunflowers,\" said Soomin. \"And red poppies!\" she exclaimed. Her mom smiled and helped Soomin pick out all the pretty colors they needed.\n\nWhen they got home, Soomin started digging in the dirt. But, oh no! The shovel was too heavy for her to lift alone. Soomin felt a bit scared and wanted to give up. That's when she saw her friend Emma walking by. \"Emma, can you help me dig?\" Soomin asked.\n\nEmma came over and together they dug a big hole for the sunflowers and poppies. Emma said, \"Look, Soomin! We made it a big square hole!\" Soomin smiled and said, \"Wow! It's huge!\"\n\nNext, Soomin had to reach high up on the fence to hang a special flag that said \"Soomin's Sunshine Garden.\" But, her arm was too short. That's when Emma came up with an idea. \"We can use two chairs to climb up!\" she said.\n\nSoomin and Emma carefully placed two chairs side by side and climbed up together. Soomin held the flag high and said, \"Yay! I did it!\"\n\nFinally, after a lot of hard work, Soomin's garden was finished. It was full of bright yellow sunflowers, red poppies, and other colorful flowers. Soomin beamed with pride and exclaimed, \"My garden is the most beautiful one on the whole block!\"\n\nEmma gave Soomin a big hug and said, \"You're so brave! I'm happy to help you achieve your dream.\" Soomin's mom took pictures of their beautiful garden and they all celebrated together.\n\nSoomin learned that when we work together with friends, we can overcome any challenge. And, she discovered the joy of growing her own sunshine garden, filled with bright colors and happiness.",
