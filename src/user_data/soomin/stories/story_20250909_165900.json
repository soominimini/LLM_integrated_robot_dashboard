  "story": "Here's a short therapeutic story for Soomin:\n\nSoomin loved playing outside with her friends. One sunny day, she decided to go on an adventure to find the most beautiful flowers in the garden.\n\nAs Soomin walked through the green grass, she saw tall trees standing all around her. \"Wow! The big trees are so high!\" she exclaimed. She wanted to reach the pretty yellow flowers that were growing on top of a hill. But, oh no! The hill was steep and rocky.\n\nJust then, her friend Luna appeared with a big smile. \"Hey, Soomin! I see you're trying to get to the beautiful flowers. Let's walk together and find some soft paths to climb up the hill.\"\n\nWith Luna's help, they found a gentle slope where Soomin could climb safely. When they reached the top, oh look! There were many colorful flowers swaying in the breeze. \"Wow! The bright red roses are so rosy!\" said Soomin.\n\nLuna added, \"And see all those white daisies? They're like a big happy family!\"\n\nTogether, Soomin and Luna picked some of the prettiest flowers to take back home to their friends. As they walked down the hill, Soomin saw many fluffy butterflies flying around them. \"Look! The little butterflies are so soft and tiny!\" she exclaimed.\n\nSoomin and Luna returned home with a big smile on their faces, feeling happy and proud of themselves for working together. From that day on, Soomin knew that whenever she wanted to find something special, all she had to do was ask her friends for help, and they would always be there to support her.\n\nThis story incorporates the speech and language therapy goals naturally:\n\n* Learning descriptive words: \"tall\", \"high\", \"green grass\", \"pretty yellow flowers\", \"soft\", \"rosy\", \"bright red roses\", \"white daisies\", \"fluffy\", \"tiny\"\n* Practicing plural forms: \"flowers\" (multiple times), \"trees\" (note: singular form used in the story, but plural form is often practiced with children)\n* Understanding spatial concepts: \"up the hill\", \"on top of a hill\", \"down the hill\"",
