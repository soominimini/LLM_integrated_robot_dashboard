  "story": "Soomin's First Day of School\n\nSoomin woke up early on a sunny day. It was their first day at school! Soomin felt a big tummy ache, not because they were hungry, but because they were worried about making new friends.\n\n\"Mommy, I don't want to go to school today,\" said Soomin, snuggling into Mommy's warm hug.\n\nBut Mommy gave Soomin a gentle nuzzle. \"You'll be brave, sweetie! You'll make lots of new friends and have so much fun.\"\n\nSoomin took a deep breath and put on their favorite shirt with the big, bright smiley face. They grabbed their brand-new backpack and headed out the door.\n\nWhen they arrived at school, Soomin saw a big sign that said \"Welcome to our school!\" Inside, there were colorful blocks, soft cushions for sitting, and pictures of happy kids playing together.\n\nSoomin's teacher, Mrs. Lee, smiled brightly and said, \"Hello, Soomin! We're so glad you're here! Who would like to show Soomin around?\"\n\nA friendly boy named Joon raised his hand and exclaimed, \"I do! I love showing new friends around!\" He grabbed Soomin's hand and said, \"Let's go see the painting table first!\"\n\nAs they walked together, Joon pointed out a big red crayon and said, \"Wow, look at that! We can use it to make our own masterpiece!\" Soomin giggled with excitement.\n\nNext, they met a gentle girl named Hana. She showed them how to play a soft, musical instrument called the kalimba. Soomin listened carefully as Hana explained what each sound meant.\n\nAfter a fun-filled morning of exploring and playing, Soomin realized that their worries were gone! They felt happy and excited about school.\n\nMrs. Lee gave everyone a big hug and said, \"We're so proud of you for being brave on your first day! Remember, making friends is like sharing crayons \u2013 we can all take turns and play together!\"\n\nSoomin beamed with pride as they walked out of the classroom with Joon and Hana by their side. They couldn't wait to come back tomorrow and show everyone what they learned!\n\nAs Mommy picked Soomin up from school, they grinned at each other and said, \"I'm so glad I came today!\"",
