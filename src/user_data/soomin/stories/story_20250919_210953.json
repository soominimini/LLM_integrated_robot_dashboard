  "story": "Soomin's Big Treasure Hunt\n\nSoomin loved playing outside! One sunny day, Soomin decided to go on a treasure hunt in the big park near her house. She wanted to find a special treasure chest hidden behind the tall trees.\n\nAs Soomin walked along the path, she saw many interesting things. She saw \"big, green\" grass and \"happy, fluffy\" ducks swimming in the pond. But then, Soomin encountered two obstacles: a narrow bridge and a small stream that blocked her way!\n\nJust when Soomin felt unsure, she met her friend, Emma, who was playing on the bridge. Emma said, \"Don't worry, Soomin! I can help you cross the bridge.\" With Emma's support, they made their way across together.\n\nAfter crossing the bridge, Soomin and Emma saw some \"bright, colorful\" flowers growing near the stream. They carefully walked along the stones to get around the water.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they met another friend, Max, who had a special tool to help them cross the stream. With Max's help, Soomin was able to reach the other side and find the treasure chest!\n\n Inside the chest, Soomin found many fun things: \"soft, cuddly\" stuffed animals, \"shiny, sparkly\" coins, and even some delicious \"juicy, sweet\" apples! Soomin was so happy to have achieved her goal with the help of her friends.\n\nSoomin learned that when we work together and use our words to ask for help, we can overcome obstacles and reach our goals. And from that day on, Soomin knew she could always count on her friends to help her find new adventures in the big park!\n\n(Note: The story integrates speech and language therapy goals naturally into the narrative, using simple sentence structures and gentle encouragement.)",
