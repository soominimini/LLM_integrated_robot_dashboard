  "story": "Here is a short therapeutic story for Soomin:\n\n**Soomin's Sunny Garden Adventure**\n\nSoomin loved playing outside. One sunny day, Soomin decided to visit the beautiful garden in the park. The garden was filled with yummy fruits and colorful flowers.\n\nAs Soomin walked along the winding path, they saw big, juicy red apples hanging from trees all around them (many apples). Soomin wanted to pick one to eat. But, oh no! A strong gust of wind blew down a tree branch, blocking the way to the apple tree!\n\nJust then, Soomin met a friendly bee named Benny. \"Hi there, little friend!\" said Benny. \"What's wrong?\" Soomin explained about the tree branch. Benny buzzed off and came back with some friends \u2013 a big, strong squirrel named Squeaky and a clever rabbit named Rosie.\n\nTogether, they worked as a team to move the branches out of the way. Squeaky used her powerful arms to lift the heavy branches, while Rosie used her quick thinking to find a path around them. Benny flew ahead to make sure it was safe.\n\nAfter working together, the path was clear! Soomin was so happy and thanked their new friends for helping them get the yummy red apples (many apples). They all celebrated with a big, sunny picnic in the garden, surrounded by beautiful flowers.\n\nSoomin learned that when you work together with friends, you can overcome any obstacle. And, oh yeah! The apples were super delicious!\n\nThis story aims to support early language development by incorporating descriptive words (e.g., \"big,\" \"juicy,\" \"colorful\"), plural forms (e.g., \"many apples\"), and spatial concepts (e.g., walking along a path, moving branches out of the way).",
