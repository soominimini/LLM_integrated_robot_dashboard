  "story": "**Soomin's Sunshine Adventure**\n\nSoomin loved playing outside on sunny days! One morning, Soomin decided to go on a journey to find the most beautiful flowers in the garden.\n\nAs Soomin walked through the garden, they saw big, bright sunflowers stretching towards the sky. \"Wow!\" thought Soomin, \"These sunflowers are as tall as Mommy!\"\n\nSoomin continued walking and came across some tiny, yellow daisies hiding behind a bush. \"Look! Baby daisies!\" exclaimed Soomin. Soomin picked one up carefully and said, \"This little daisy has two petals on each side.\"\n\nJust then, Soomin's friend, a happy butterfly named Luna, landed on their shoulder. \"Hi, Soomin! I see you're looking for flowers,\" said Luna. \"Would you like to fly with me and find some more?\" asked Luna.\n\nSoomin was so excited that they forgot about a big puddle in front of them. Splish-splash! But don't worry, Luna helped Soomin jump over the puddle. On the other side, they found a beautiful patch of colorful flowers. \"Wow!\" said Soomin, \"There are many red roses and purple lavender flowers!\"\n\nLuna smiled at Soomin's happy face and said, \"You did it, Soomin! You're so brave!\" As a reward for their bravery, Luna took Soomin to a special spot where the most beautiful sunflower of all was waiting.\n\nSoomin beamed with pride, \"I found it! I'm so happy!\" And from that day on, Soomin knew they could overcome any obstacle and find the beauty in the world around them.\n\n(Note: The story meets the speech and language therapy goals by using descriptive words like \"big\", \"bright\", \"tiny\", and \"yellow\" to encourage learning of descriptive words. It also practices plural forms with phrases like \"two petals on each side\" and uses spatial concepts, such as \"behind a bush\" and \"on the other side of the puddle\".)",
