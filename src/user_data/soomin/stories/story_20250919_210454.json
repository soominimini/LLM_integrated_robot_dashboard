  "story": "**Soomin's Sunny Adventure**\n\nSoomin was a happy little rabbit who loved playing outside. One sunny day, Soomin decided to go on an adventure to find the most beautiful flower in the forest.\n\nAs Soomin hopped along the winding path, the warm sunshine made everything feel happy and bright. The trees were tall and green, with soft leaves that whispered in the breeze. Soomin saw a big, red ladybug flying around a colorful patch of flowers. \"Wow!\" said Soomin, \"Look at all those pretty flowers!\"\n\nBut then, Soomin came across a small stream. The water was sparkling and clear, but it made the path slippery. Soomin didn't know how to cross it. Just as Soomin was thinking about what to do, a wise old owl perched on a nearby tree called out, \"Don't worry, little one! I can help you.\"\n\nThe owl said, \"We need to find some stepping stones to get across the stream.\" Together, they looked around and found many smooth rocks. The owl taught Soomin how to count them: \"One rock, two rocks, three rocks... we'll use five big rocks to cross the stream!\"\n\nAfter successfully crossing the stream, Soomin's heart was full of joy! With one more hop, Soomin reached a beautiful garden filled with flowers of every color \u2013 red, yellow, blue, and purple. In the center of the garden, under a big sunflower, grew the most magnificent flower Soomin had ever seen.\n\nSoomin felt proud and happy. \"Yay!\" said Soomin, \"I did it! And I found the most beautiful flower in the forest!\" The owl smiled and said, \"You're so brave, little one! You can do anything when you have friends to help.\"\n\nFrom that day on, Soomin knew that with a little help from friends and some brave steps, anything was possible!\n\nThis story aims to support early language development by:\n\n* Using simple sentence structures\n* Incorporating descriptive words (warm sunshine, soft leaves, sparkling water)\n* Practicing plural forms (flowers, rocks)\n* Understanding spatial concepts (across the stream, in the center of the garden)",
