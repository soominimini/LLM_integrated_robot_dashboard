  "story": "Soomin's Sunny Garden Adventure\n\nSoomin loved playing outside. One day, Soomin decided to visit her friend, Mrs. Lily, who had the most beautiful garden in the whole neighborhood.\n\nAs Soomin walked through the gate, she saw a bright yellow sun shining down on the flowers. \"Wow!\" said Soomin. \"The sun is like a big smile in the sky!\"\n\nMrs. Lily greeted Soomin with a warm hug. \"Hello, dear! I'm so glad you're here. Today, we're going to plant some new flowers in my garden.\"\n\nSoomin's eyes widened as she looked around at all the different plants and flowers. \"I see big flowers,\" said Soomin, pointing at a patch of bright red poppies. \"And little flowers,\" she added, spotting a cluster of tiny daisies.\n\nJust then, Mrs. Lily pointed to a small hill in the garden. \"We need to roll some rocks down this hill to make it flat for our new flowers.\" But when Soomin tried to push one rock, it was too heavy for her. \"I'm stuck!\" she said, feeling frustrated.\n\nMrs. Lily smiled and said, \"Don't worry, Soomin! Sometimes we need help from friends to overcome big challenges.\" She called out to their friend, Timmy, who was playing nearby with his toy trucks. Timmy came over and together they pushed the rock down the hill.\n\nAs they worked, Mrs. Lily taught Soomin about spatial concepts. \"Look, Soomin,\" she said, pointing to a spot on the hill. \"This is where we want to put our new flowers. And if we roll this big rock here, it will make a nice flat space for them.\"\n\nWith Timmy's help, they finally got all the rocks out of the way and made the garden smooth and ready for their new flowers. Soomin felt proud of herself for trying something new and asking for help when she needed it.\n\nAs they planted the flowers, Mrs. Lily said, \"You know what? This is a great example of collaboration! We worked together to achieve our goal.\" Soomin beamed with pride, knowing that she had helped make Mrs. Lily's garden even more beautiful.\n\nThe sun was shining brighter now, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. Soomin felt happy knowing that she had learned a new word: \"collaboration\". And as they all celebrated their success, Soomin realized that sometimes, asking for help is the best way to overcome challenges and make something truly special happen!",
