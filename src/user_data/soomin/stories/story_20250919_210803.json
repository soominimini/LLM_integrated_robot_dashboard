  "story": "**Soomin's Sunny Adventure**\n\nSoomin loved playing outside on sunny days! One day, Soomin said, \"I want to pick some juicy, red apples from the tree in our backyard!\" But, oh no! The apples were all the way up high, and Soomin couldn't reach them.\n\nAs Soomin looked up at the branches, a friendly squirrel named Squeaky scampered down. \"Hello, little friend!\" said Squeaky. \"I see you want some yummy apples. Let me help!\"\n\nSqueaky showed Soomin how to climb the stairs leading up to the treehouse. \"Wow! I love climbing!\" exclaimed Soomin. From the top of the stairs, they could see many beautiful flowers blooming on either side \u2013 red roses, blue forget-me-nots, and yellow sunflowers.\n\nBut then, a tiny hurdle appeared: a big basket was blocking the path to the apples. Squeaky chuckled and said, \"Don't worry! We can lift it together.\" Soomin and Squeaky worked as a team, lifting the basket high above their heads.\n\nAt last, they reached the tree where the delicious apples hung. Soomin picked two juicy apples and took a big bite... Mmm! They were so sweet!\n\nSoomin turned to Squeaky with a happy smile and said, \"Thank you for helping me get my favorite snack!\" Squeaky smiled back, saying, \"Anytime, little friend! You're very brave!\"\n\n**Did you enjoy Soomin's adventure?**\n\nThis story supports language development by:\n\n* Using descriptive words like \"juicy,\" \"red,\" \"yummy,\" and \"delicious\"\n* Practicing plural forms with \"apples\" (more than one apple)\n* Understanding spatial concepts through climbing stairs, lifting a basket, and reaching high branches.",
